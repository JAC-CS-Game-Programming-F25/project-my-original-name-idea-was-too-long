    "riffa": "Riffa\nThe rules of Riffa are simple: each player rolls the dice until they get a pair. They then roll the third die one more time, and add up the score of all three dice. Once both players have a score, the player with the highest score wins. On a tie, the match is reset and both players roll again.",
    "triga": "Triga\nIn Triga there are two stages in each match. On each player's first roll, if they get a total below 7 or above 14, or if they get three of a kind, this is called the Triga, and that player wins immediately. If they instead roll any number from 7 to 14, this becomes their mark. The next player then does the same, with the additional danger that if they roll the opponent's mark, the opponent wins. After each player's first roll, the marks are set and you can no longer get a Triga. The players each take turns rolling the dice until one of their marks are rolled, with the player whose mark was rolled winning the match.",
    "panquist": "Panquist\nIn Panquist there are two stages in each match. On each player's first roll, they must keep rolling until they get a total from 7 to 14, which becomes their mark. From then on, if a player's mark is rolled, that player wins the match. The proportion of the stakes won is determined by the specific combination of dice which added up to the mark, giving out either 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, or the full winnings, the roll of which is called the Panquist. The rolls and their winnings are as follows:\n\n7:  5+1+1 or 4+2+1 are 1/2, 2+2+3 is 3/4, and 3+3+1 is Panquist\n8:  5+2+1 is 1/4, 4+3+1 is 1/2, 6+1+1 or 2+2+4 are 3/4, and 3+3+2 is Panquist\n9:  6+2+1 or 5+3+1 are 1/4, 4+3+2 is 1/2, 2+2+5 or 3+3+3 are 3/4, and 4+4+1 is Panquist\n10:  5+4+1 or 5+3+2 are 1/4, 6+3+1 is 1/2, 2+2+6 or 4+3+3 are 3/4, and 4+4+2 is Panquist\n11:  6+3+2 or 5+4+2 are 1/4, 6+4+1 is 1/2, 5+5+1 or 4+4+3 are 3/4, and 3+3+5 is Panquist\n12:  6+5+1 or 6+4+2 are 1/4, 5+4+3 is 1/2, 5+5+2 or 4+4+4 are 3/4, and 3+3+6 is Panquist\n13:  6+5+2 is 1/4, 6+4+3 is 1/2, 6+6+1 or 5+5+3 are 3/4, and 4+4+5 is Panquist\n14:  6+5+3 is 1/2, 6+6+2 or 5+5+4 are 3/4, and 4+4+6 is Panquist"
